                                    </span>I graduated highschool in "Rochepol Jane Academy" during 2020 with a consistent high honor. <br /> Rochepol Jane Academy is a also the same school that I study in elementary and generally spent almost my childhood life in there. <br />Regarding my academic performance, I was a consistent high honor and the highest honor I got is when I was 2nd grade placing 2nd honor. <br /> I wasn't very into studying back then but later on, in the middle of my highschool journey, suddenly it got harder and it forced me to study to catch up. </p>

                                    </span>I graduated Senior Highschool in "Theresian School of Cavite" during 2022, again, still a consistent high honor student, mainly because of online class. The Course That I took was STEM and was planning to be a computer engineer, however, I didn't continue Computer Engineering course later in college. Not a lot of interesting happened in my senior years, mainly because of the new normal of COVID 19 back then.</p>
